            <p>
                I'm An, while mainly being a backend developer who has also worked as a DevOps and AI(natural language
                processing). I'm
                currently working on my Operating system written in c and am open to working with anything interesting.
                <br>
                I have worked with Python, JS, Java and C before (ordered in familiarity level).

            <a style="font-size: xx-large; font-weight: bold;" href="https://luu.memorial/">Luu</a>
            <p>Luu was created as a request from my friend, he wanted 2 things:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>His children can inherit his movies ONLY AFTER he dies.</li>
                <li>A secure way to send messages securely.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To do this Luu would: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Encrypt his message and send the data to his children but they won't have the key yet.
                </li>
                <li>Keep the key in our server and only send it after he dies.</li>
                <li>To confirm that my friend has died, I and several of his friends (who are unknown to each other)
                    would receive an email from LUU several years from now to vote if we have heard anything from him
                    recently, if not we'd assume that he has died and the key would be sent to his children.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>And Luu had become a secure mail-sending service with a robust voting system.</p>
            <p>I designed and built the backend for this project</p>

            <a style="font-size: xx-large; font-weight: bold;" href="https://www.qmcapital.vn/">QM CAPITAL</a>
            <p>QM CAPITAL is a trading, market analysis service. I enjoyed working with a large amount of data. While
                working here. I also did:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Implemented majority of APIs for the web application.</li>
                <li>Designed and built backtest micro-service using Kafka as a queue service.</li>
                <li>Optimize legacy SQL database for fast query time.</li>
                <li>Built CI/CD gitlab pipelines for staging/deploying.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Overall i believe i did what i could here before moving on and the perk of managing a small backend team
                was stressful but rewarding</p>

            <p>Relate space is a redesign of mindmaps for digital information. I worked with their team as a Contractor
                for a few key features:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> Designed and implemented a graph distance-based search engine to help users filter massive amounts
                    of data.
                </li>
                <li>Implemented One Drive and Google Drive which help users transition from their familiar service to
                    ours.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I wanted to do more with the search engine intergrating image searching using auto image tagging but they
                didn't have the budget for it which was a shame.</p>
