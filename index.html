            <p>

                <br>
                I mostly use <span style="font-weight: bold;">Python</span> but can work with <span
                    style="font-weight: bold;">Javascript</span> and its stacks as well.

                <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">I WILL NOT USE
                    AI LANGUAGE MODELS FOR MY WORKS.</span>

            <a style="font-size: xx-large; font-weight: bold;" href="https://luu.memorial/">Luu</a>
            <p>Luu was created as a request from my friend, he wanted 2 things:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>His children can inherit his movies ONLY AFTER he died.</li>
                <li>A secure way to send message securely.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To do this Luu would: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Encrypt his message and send the data directly to his children but they won't have the key just yet.
                </li>
                <li>Keep the key in our server and only send it after he died.</li>
                <li>In order to confirm that my friend has died, me and several of his friends (which are unknown to
                    eachother) would receive an email from LUU several years from now to vote if we have heard anything
                    from him recently, if not we'd assume that he has died and the key would be sent to his children.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>And Luu had became a secure mail sending service with a robust voting system.</p>

                code as well.</p>
